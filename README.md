# Kickstarter Fundraising Analysis in Excel
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the factors of a successful fundraising campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges
  Based upon the graph below, I can tell just at a glance that the most succesful campaigns were started during spring while the least successful month being december. The best month to do a campaign in is the month of May, which had over 100 succesful theater campaigns.![Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date](https://github.com/TristanVaccarino/Kickstarter-Fundraising-Analysis-in-Excel/blob/main/Kickstarter_Fundraising_Analysis/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_Based_on_Launch%20%20.png)
  In comparing outcomes and goals below, we can see that the most succesful amount of campaigns occur when the goal is less than or equal to $1000. The next succesful campaigns had a goal betwen $35000 to $44900. The least succesful campaigns are in the $45,000+ range. ![Outcomes vs Goals](https://github.com/TristanVaccarino/Kickstarter-Fundraising-Analysis-in-Excel/blob/main/Kickstarter_Fundraising_Analysis/Resources/Outcomes-vs-Goals.png)
    A few hurdles that i ran into while reading this data is the combination of category and subcategory in one column, because of this i had to break down parent categories and subcategories into two different columns to make it easier to narrow down.
  Some limitations of this dataset is the lack of precise location and fund usage. These two things can really lock into what the best fundraisers do in order to be succesful. Do some fundraisers do better in the west coast? Are plays a better bet in New York? Is there more money going to marketing or production? These questions can lead to a better understanding of what makes a fundraiser succesful.
  Some other useful graphs would be ones comparing outcome with average donation or backer count. Another possibly telling graph would be one that looks at the length of the fundraisers and which did better.
