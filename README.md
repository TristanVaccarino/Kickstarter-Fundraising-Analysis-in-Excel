## Analysis and Challenges
Based upon the graph "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date", I can tell just at a glance that the most succesful campaigns were started during spring while the least successful month being december. The best month to do a campaign in is the month of May, which had over 100 succesful theater campaigns.
In comparing outcomes and goals we can see that the most succesful amount of campaigns occur when the goal is less than or equal to $1000. The next succesful campaigns had a goal betwen $35000 to $44900
